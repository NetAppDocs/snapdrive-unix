Data on the LUN disappears, when you add an existing LUN to a volume group.

If you add an existing LUN to a volume group that is managed by the LVM, and then execute a pvcreate command, the data is overwritten.

== Workaround

If you need data that is on an existing LUN, you must migrate that data to a LUN that you create using the LVM. Complete the following steps.

. Create new LUNs.
. Place the LUNs under LVM control by using the pvcreate, the vgcreate, and the lvcreate commands.
. Copy data from the existing LUNs to the LUNs you created and placed under LVM control.
