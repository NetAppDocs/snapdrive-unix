The daemon cannot be started when the daemon finds few stale entries in the snapdrive process.

The following error message appears when the daemon is started or restarted.

----
Starting snapdrive daemon: snapdrive daemon port 4094 is in use ...

During the daemon restart/start operation, you can encounter staled snapdrive process entries, which results the daemon to fail.

The workaround for this problem is to execute the following:

* Manually delete the stale entries in the snapdrive process.
* Find the free ports that are available in the host. Then, in the snapdrive.conf file, specify the port in the option contact-http-port-sdu-daemon.
