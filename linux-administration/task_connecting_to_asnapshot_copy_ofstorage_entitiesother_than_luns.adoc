You can use the snapdrive snap connect command for connecting to a Snapshot copy that contains storage entities other than LUNs. This command cannot be used when destination names you provide are currently in use or, there is a file system name that is used as a mountpoint.

. Enter the following command: snapdrive snap connect -snapname fspec_set [fspec_set...] -snapname long_snap_name [-igroup ig_name [ig_name...]] [-autoexpand] [-autorename] [-nopersist] [{-reserve | -noreserve}] [-readonly] [-split]
+
In the preceding usage, fspec_set has the following format:
+
{-dg | -fs | -hostvol} src_file_spec [dest_file_spec] [{-destdg | -destvg} dgname] [{-destlv | -desthv} lvname]
+
This command must always start with the name of the storage entity you want to connect (for example, -dg, -hostvol, or -fs). If you specify an NFS mountpoint, you cannot specify non-NFS entities (-vg, -dg, -fs, -lvol or -hostvol) on the same command line.
+
NOTE: On Linux hosts, SnapDrive for UNIX supports the Snapshot connect operation on the originating host, unless the LUN is part of the Linux LVM1 volume manager.

SnapDrive for UNIX clones the LUNs you specify and connects them to a new location.

The following command line connects a disk group and uses the default names as the destination names (that is, it creates them from the source names):

----
# snapdrive snap connect -vg vg1 -snapname
filer1:/vol/vol1:vg1snapshot
connecting vg1:
LUN copy vg1_lun1_0 ... created
(original: filer1:/vol/vol1/vg1_lun1)
mapping new lun(s) ... done
discovering new lun(s) ... done
Importing vg1
----

The following command line connects a disk group with a single host volume. It also specifies a name for the destination host volume and disk group:

----
# snapdrive snap connect -lvol vg1/vol1 vg1copy/vol1copy -snapname
filer1:/vol/vol1:vg1snapshot
connecting vg1:
LUN copy vg1_lun1_0 ... created
(original: filer1:/vol/vol1/vg1_lun1)
mapping new lun(s) ... done
discovering new lun(s) ... done
Importing vg1copy
----

The following command line connects a disk group with two LUNs and two file systems. It specifies a destination name for each of the file systems, the host volume for one of the file systems, and the disk groups for both file systems:

----
# snapdrive snap connect -fs mnt/fs1 /mnt/fs1copy -destvg vg1copy \
-fs /mnt/fs2 /mnt/fs2copy -destlv vg1copy/vol2copy -destvg vg1copy
\ -snapname filer1:/vol/vol1:vg1snapshot
connecting vg1:
LUN copy vg1_lun1_0 ... created
(original: filer1:/vol/vol1/vg1_lun1)
LUN copy vg1_lun2_0 ... created
(original: filer1:/vol/vol1/vg1_lun2)
mapping new lun(s) ... done
discovering new lun(s) ... done
Importing vg1copy
----

The following command line includes the -autoexpand option as it connects a disk group with two file systems. It uses the default names as the destination names (that is, it creates them from the source names):

----
# snapdrive snap connect -lvol mnt/fs1 -snapname
filer1:/vol/vol1:vg1snapshot \
-autoexpand
connecting vg1:
LUN copy vg1_lun1_0 ... created
(original: filer1:/vol/vol1/vg1_lun1)
LUN copy vg1_lun2_0 ... created
(original: filer1:/vol/vol1/vg1_lun2)
mapping new lun(s) ... done
discovering new lun(s) ... done
Importing vg1
----

The following command line includes the-autorename option as it connects a disk group with two file systems and two LUNs:

----
# snapdrive snap connect -fs mnt/fs1 -snapname
filer1:/vol/vol1:vg1snapshot \
-autorename
connecting vg1:
LUN copy vg1_lun1_0 ... created
(original: filer1:/vol/vol1/vg1_lun1)
LUN copy vg1_lun2_0 ... created
(original: filer1:/vol/vol1/vg1_lun2)
mapping new lun(s) ... done
discovering new lun(s) ... done
Importing vg1_0

In the following example, file system 1 (fs1) resides on storage system1, and file system 2 (fs2) resides on storage system1 and also on storage system2, which is the partner storage system. File system 3 (fs3) resides on storage system1, partner storage system 2, and storage system 3, which is not part of the HA pair. An additional file system, fs4, resides entirely on storage system 4.

The following command creates a Snapshot copy of fs1, fs2, fs3, and fs4:

----
snapdrive snap create -fs /mnt/fs1 /mnt/fs2 /mnt/fs3 /mnt/fs4
-snapname fs_all_snap
----

The next command connect fs1 and fs2 on the destination storage system. Both fs1 and fs2 reside on a HA pair, so you can restore them with one command:

----
snapdrive snap connect -fs /mnt/fs1 /mt/fs2 -snapname fs_all_snap
----

The following command restores fs4:

----
snapdrive snap connect -fs /mnt/fs4 -snapname fs_all_snap
----

SnapDrive for UNIX cannot connect fs3 on the destination storage system, because this file system resides on storage system1, storage system 2, and storage system 3.
