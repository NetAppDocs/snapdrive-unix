You can configure SnapDrive for UNIX to use HTTP for your host platform.

Ensure that you are logged in as a root user.

. Make a backup of the snapdrive.conf file.
. Open the snapdrive.conf file in a text editor.
. Change the value of the use-https-to-filer variable to off.
+
A good practice any time you modify the snapdrive.conf file is to perform the following steps:

 .. Comment out the line you want to modify.
 .. Copy the commented-out line.
 .. Un-comment the copied text by removing the pound (#) sign.
 .. Modify the value.

. Save the file after you make your changes.
+
SnapDrive for UNIX automatically checks this file each time it starts. You must restart the SnapDrive for UNIX daemon for the changes to take effect.
