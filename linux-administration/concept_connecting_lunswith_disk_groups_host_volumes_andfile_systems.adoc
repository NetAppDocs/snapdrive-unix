To use the `snapdrive storage connect` command to connect LUNs that have disk groups, host volumes and file systems, you need to follow the syntax.

Enter the following command:

`*snapdrive storage connect-fs _file_spec_ -hostvol _file_spec_ -lun _long_lun_name_ [_lun_name..._] [-igroup _ig_name_ [_ig_name..._]] [-nopersist] [-mntopts _options_] [-fstype _type_] [-vmtype _type_]`*`

== Example: Connecting a file system created on a LUN

----
# snapdrive storage connect -fs /mnt/fs -lun f270-221-189:/vol/vol0/lun111 -nolvm
mapping lun(s) ... done
discovering lun(s) ... done
LUN f270-221-189:/vol/vol0/lun111 connected
- device filename(s): /dev/vx/dmp/fas2700_939
----

== Example: Connecting a file system created on a RDM LUN

----
# snapdrive storage connect -fs /mnt/fs -lun lech:/vol/vol1/lun1 -nolvm
exporting new lun(s) to Guest OS ... done
discovering lun(s) ... done
LUN lech:/vol/vol1/lun1 connected
- device filename(s): /dev/sdb
