In some cases, `snapdrive snap disconnect` operation fails to delete cloned volume and the error message `does not look SnapDrive-generated` appears.

The workaround for the problem is to revert to the original name of the Snapshot copy, and ensure that the `_bypass-snapdrive-clone-generated-check_` is set to on in the `snapdrive.conf` file.
