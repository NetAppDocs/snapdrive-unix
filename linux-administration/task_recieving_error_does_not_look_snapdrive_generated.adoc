In some cases, snapdrive snap disconnect operation fails to delete cloned volume and the error message does not look SnapDrive-generated appears.

The workaround for the problem is to revert to the original name of the Snapshot copy, and ensure that the bypass-snapdrive-clone-generated-check is set to on in the snapdrive.conf file.
