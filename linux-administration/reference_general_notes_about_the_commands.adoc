SnapDrive for UNIX commands have options such as -dg, -vg, -lvol and -hostvol.

Some general notes about the command follow:

* The -dg and -vg options are synonyms that reflect the fact that some operating systems refer to disk groups and others refer to volume groups. This guide uses -dg to refer to both disk groups and volume groups.
* The -lvol and -hostvol options are synonyms that reflect the fact that some operating systems refer to logical volumes and others refer to host volumes. This guide uses -hostvol to refer to both logical volumes and host volumes.
* It is better to use the default igroup and not specify an igroup explicitly by including the -igroup option.
