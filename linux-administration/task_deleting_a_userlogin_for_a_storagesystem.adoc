You can delete a user login for one or more storage systems, by executing the snapdrive config delete command.

Ensure that you are logged in as a root user.

. Enter the following command: snapdrive config delete appliance_name [appliance_name]
+
appliance_name is the name of the storage system for which you want to delete the user login information.
+
SnapDrive for UNIX removes the user name or password login information for the storage systems you specify.
+
NOTE: To enable SnapDrive for UNIX to access the storage system, you must specify a new user login.
