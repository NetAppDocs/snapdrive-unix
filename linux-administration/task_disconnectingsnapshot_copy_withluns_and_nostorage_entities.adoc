You can use the snapdrive snap disconnect command to disconnect a Snapshot copy that contains LUNs having no storage entities.

. Enter the following command syntax: snapdrive snap disconnect -lunlong_lun_name [lun_name...]

SnapDrive for UNIX removes the mappings for the storage entities specified in the command line.

The following command removes the mappings to luna and lunb on the storage system toaster:

----
# snapdrive snap disconnect -lun toaster:/vol/vol1/luna lunb
