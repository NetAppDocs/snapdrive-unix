[.lead]
The SnapRestore and SnapConnect operations does not work if the multipathing type is migrated.

If you have an existing multipathing type set as `_None_`, and later you tend to change the multipathing type as `_NativeMPIO_`, when you execute Snapconnect and SnapRestore operations for the existing Snapshot copies, you might encounter an error message as `"Unable to find multipathing software linuxnull as present in the snapshot"`.

Example for SnapRestore operation

----
snapdrive snap restore -fs /mnt/tstmp -snapname withoutmpio
0002-105 Command error: Unable to find multipathing software linuxnull as present in the snapshot
----

Example for Snapconnect operation

----
snapdrive snap connect -fs /mnt/tstmp -snapname
f3020-225-54:/vol/vol1:withoutmpio -autorename
0002-105 Command error: Unable to find multipathing software
linuxnull as present in the snapshot
