You can use SnapDrive for UNIX commands to provision storage by creating a LUN on the storage system.

. At the command-line interface, enter the following command: snapdrive storage create -lunlong_lun_name -lunsize [lun_name ...] -lunsizesize [{-reserve | -noreserve}] -igroup ig_name [ig_name ...]]ig_name[ig_name ...]]
+
SnapDrive for UNIX creates the LUNs you specify.

== Example: creating three 10 GB LUNs on a storage system

snapdrive storage create -lun acctfiler:/vol/vol1/lunA lunB lunC - lunsize 10g
