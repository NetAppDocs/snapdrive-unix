In mixed SAN and NFS environments, the management and data interface must be mapped so that the first data interface is the same as the management interface.

In the following example, the management interface is `10.72.197.91`, and the data interface is `10.72.220.91`.

#snapdrive config set -mgmtpath f3050-197-91 f3050-197-91 f3050-197-91 f3050-220-91

#snapdrive config list -mgmtpath
 system name        management interface   datapath interface
