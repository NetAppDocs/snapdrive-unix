While renaming Snapshot copies, ensure that the two Snapshot copies do not have the same name.

Follow these guidelines when you use the `snapdrive snap rename` command:

* An error message occurs if you try to rename a Snapshot copy to a different storage system volume.
* An error message occurs if the new name for the Snapshot copy already exists. You can use the `-force` option to force SnapDrive for UNIX to change the name without generating an error message.
