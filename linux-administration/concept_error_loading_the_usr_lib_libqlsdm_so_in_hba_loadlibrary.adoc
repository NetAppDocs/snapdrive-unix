On all updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Oracle Enterprise Linux 4 hosts with iSCSI setup, all SnapDrive for UNIX commands error out.

During unloading or uninstalling the QLogic driver, the libHBAAPI library remains in the /usr/lib file and is not removed by the QLogic ./install scripts. The following error message appears as

----
HBA_LoadLibrary: Encountered and error loading: /usr/lib/libqlsdm.so
----

== Workaround

Rename or move (mv) the libqlsdm.so library. For example, mv /usr/lib/libqlsdm.so /usr/lib/libqlsdm.so.old.
