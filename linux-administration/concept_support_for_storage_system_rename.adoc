SnapDrive allows renaming of storage systems. If a Snapshot copy is created and the storage system is renamed after the copy was created, SnapDrive allows you to execute Snapshot operations as long as you have re-authenticated all of your clients (hosts).

Snapshot operations such as restore, connect, disconnect, display, and delete continues to work in the host system only after you re-authenticate your clients. You must re-authenticate because the host name is used as part of the registry key to hold the password.
