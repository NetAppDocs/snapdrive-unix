The audit log shows information about commands you issued with SnapDrive for UNIX.

The audit log file maintains the history of the following information:

* The commands issued.
* The return value from those commands.
* The user ID of the user who invoked the command.
* A timestamp indicating when the command started (with no return code) and another timestamp indicating when the command finished (with a return code). The audit log record shows only information about snapdrive use (issued commands).
