You need to change few configuration variables in the snapdrive.conf file for MPIO to work with Linux.

After installing SnapDrive for UNIX on the host, edit the /opt/Netapp/snapdrive/snapdrive.conf file and change the following settings to the appropriate values:

----
enable-implicit-host-preparation=on  # Enable implicit host preparation for LUN creation
  default-transport="FCP"  # Transport type to use for storage provisioning, when a decision is needed
  multipathing-type= "nativempio"  # Multipathing software to use when more than one multipathing solution is available
----

Restart the SnapDrive daemon for the snapdrive.conf file changes to take effect. After SnapDrive daemon restart, SnapDrive commands start using the DM-MP stack.
