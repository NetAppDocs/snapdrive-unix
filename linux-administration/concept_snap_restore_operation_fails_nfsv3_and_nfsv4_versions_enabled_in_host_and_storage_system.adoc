Snap restore operation fails when there are nfsv3 and nfsv4 versions enabled in the host and storage system.

If you have nfsv3 and nfsv4 versions enabled in the host and storage system, and mount the volume on the host without -o vers option, then nobody:nobody ownership is set for files and directories.

== Workaround

It is recommended to use -o vers option while mounting the nfs volume or check the nfs default options to an appropriate value on the host.
