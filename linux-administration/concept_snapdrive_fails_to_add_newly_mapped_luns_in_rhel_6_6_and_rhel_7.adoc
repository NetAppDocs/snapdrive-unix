[.lead]
The rescan script /usr/bin/rescan-scsi-bus.sh bundled with the sg3_utils package fails to add the newly mapped LUNs in SnapDrive for UNIX running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 and later.

== Workaround

. Create a file called dynamic-lun-rescan.sh in the /root directory and provide full permission to the file.
. Add the command /usr/bin/rescan-scsi-bus.sh -a -r in the dynamic-lun-rescan.sh file.
