You can create a specific number of new LUNs using SnapDrive for UNIX. SnapDrive for UNIX provides specific commands for this purpose.

Ensure that the host is ready to create specific number of new LUNs. These LUNs reside on a storage system that is mapped to the host.

.Steps

. `snapdrive config prepare luns -count count`
+
`-count` is the number of new LUNs for which you want the host to be prepared.
+
On Linux, this command adds a new `/dev/sg` device file for each potential LUN for which a device file is not currently available.

[NOTE]
====
If you have manually edited the `/kernel/drv/lpfc.conf` file for persistent bindings, ensure that the FC-bind-WWPN entry is after

`# BEGIN: LPUTIL-managed Persistent Bindings`.
