You can use SnapDrive for UNIX to create LUNs, a file system directly on a LUN, disk groups, host volumes, and file systems created on LUNs.

SnapDrive for UNIX automatically handles all the tasks needed to set up LUNs associated with these entities, including preparing the host, performing discovery mapping, creating the entity, and connecting to the entity you create. You can also specify which LUNs SnapDrive for UNIX uses to provide storage for the entity you request.

You do not need to create the LUNs and the storage entity at the same time. If you create the LUNs separately, you can create the storage entity later using the existing LUNs.
