The SnapDrive storage `create` command fails when multiple SAN paths are present but multipathing is disabled.

For example, for two iSCSI LIFs for an SVM:

----
[root@scspr0189449001 etc]# iscsiadm --mode session --rescan
Rescanning session [sid: 1, target: iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.f7335762b23e11e695360050569c153a:vs.3, portal: 10.224.70.253,3260]
Rescanning session [sid: 2, target: iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.f7335762b23e11e695360050569c153a:vs.3, portal: 10.224.70.254,3260]
----

When `multipathing-type` is set to `none` in the snapdrive.conf file and the multipath service is disabled, trying a storage create using LVM, returns the following error:

----
root@scspr0189449001 etc]# snapdrive storage create -fs /mnt/test -lun rgvsim:/vol/asmvol/test -lunsize 500m
        LUN rgvsim:/vol/asmvol/test ... created
        mapping new lun(s) ... done
        discovering new lun(s) ... *failed*
        Cleaning up ...
         - LUN rgvsim:/vol/asmvol/test ... deleted
         0001-422 Admin error: LVM initialization of luns failed:
        Device /dev/sdb,/dev/sdc not found (or ignored by filtering).
----

This happens because the `pvcreate` command uses both the devices separated by a comma as a single device `pvcreate /dev/sdb,/dev/sdc` and a device named `/dev/sdb,/dev/sdc` that does not exist.

When there are multiple paths to storage and LVM needs to be used, then multipathing must be enabled.
