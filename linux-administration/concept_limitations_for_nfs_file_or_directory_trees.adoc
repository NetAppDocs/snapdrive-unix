SnapDrive does not provide storage provisioning commands for NFS files or directory trees. SnapDrive supports `snapdrive snap create` and `snapdrive snap restore` commands only if you are using Data ONTAP 7.3.5 and later.

The `snapdrive snap connect` and `snapdrive snap disconnect` commands involve NFS and use the Data ONTAP FlexVol volumes feature for read and write access. Therefore you can run these commands only if you are using Data ONTAP 7.3.5 or later. The configurations with Data ONTAP 7.3.5 or later and traditional volumes enable you to create and restore Snapshot copies, but the Snapshot connect operation is restricted to only read-only access.
