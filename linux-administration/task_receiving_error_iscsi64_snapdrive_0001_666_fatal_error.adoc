If your `snapdrive snap connect` command fails with `iscsi64 snapdrive: 0001-666 FATAL error`:, following is the workaround described.

.Steps
. Add `filter = [ "r|/dev/cciss/.*|" ]` as the first filter to `/etc/lvm/lvm.conf` file, if the filter is not specified already.
. Remove `/etc/lvm/.cache` and issue `pvscan` to confirm that none of the `/dev/cciss/*` entries show.
