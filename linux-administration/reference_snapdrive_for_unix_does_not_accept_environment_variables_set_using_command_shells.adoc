You are unable to execute SnapDrive for UNIX commands, both because the environment variables set through a command shell are not accepted in SnapDrive for UNIX, and when $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and snapcreate-check-nonpersistent-nfs parameters are set to off.

== Workaround

Use a wrapper script for the SnapDrive for UNIX binary and set the environment variables as visible for the binary.
