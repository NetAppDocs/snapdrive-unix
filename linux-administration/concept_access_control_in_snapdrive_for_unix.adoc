SnapDrive for UNIX allows you to control the level of access that each host has to each storage system to which the host is connected.

The access level in SnapDrive for UNIX indicates which operations the host is allowed to perform when it targets a given storage system. Except for the show and list operations, the access control permissions can affect all Snapshot and storage operations.
