You can configure multiple data interfaces for a single management interface in an NFS environment, so that you can separate management traffic from data traffic on your storage system.

. Set the configuration for the new management interface: snapdrive config set root
+
----
# snapdrive config set root f3050-197-91
Password for root:
Retype password:
----
+
The following is an example for a storage virtual machine (SVM, formerly known as Vserver).
+
----
# snapdrive config set vsadmin clstr-vs2
Password for vsadmin:
Retype password:
----

. Configure the data interface for the new management interface: snapdrive config set
+
----
# snapdrive config set -mgmtpath f3050-197-91 f3050-220-91#
----
+
In the preceding command, `f3050-197-191` is the management interface and `f3050-220-91` is the data interface.
+
The following is an example for an SVM.
+
----
snapdrive config set -mgmtpath clstr-vs2  clstr-vs2-2
system name   management interface   datapath interface
-------------------------------------------------------
clstr-vs2     10.72.220.203          10.72.221.155
----
+
In the output, `10.72.220.203` is the management interface and `10.72.221.155` is the data interface.
