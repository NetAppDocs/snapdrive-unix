[marc]$ snapdrive storage create -lun storage_array1:/vol/vol1/lun5 lun6 -lun storage_array1:/vol/vol2/lun2 -lunsize 100m
0002-332 Admin error:SD.Storage.Write access denied on volume storage_array1:/vol/vol1 for user nis_domain\marc on Operations Manager server ops_mngr_server
SD.Storage.Write access denied on volume storage_array1:/vol/vol2 for user nis_domain\marc on Operations Manager server ops_mngr_server

In this example, three LUNs reside on two storage system volume, vol1 and vol2. User Marc belongs to nis_domain and is not authorized to create filespec on vol1 and vol2. SnapDrive for UNIX displays the two error messages in the preceding example. The error messages show that the user must have `SD.Storage.Write` access on vol1 and vol2.
