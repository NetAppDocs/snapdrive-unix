[.lead]
SnapDrive for UNIX does not delete LUNs with exported disk groups on Linux LVM2.

If you export a disk group (dg) on Linux LVM2 and try to delete the LUN, the delete operation fails.

== Workaround

You have to use vgimport <dgname>to import the disk group and then use the following command to delete the disk group and LUN:# snapdrive storage delete - dg <dgname> [-full]
