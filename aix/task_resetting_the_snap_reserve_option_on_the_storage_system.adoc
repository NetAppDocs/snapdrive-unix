When you use Data ONTAP in a Fibre Channel or Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) environment, you should reset the `snap reserve` option to zero percent on the storage system, for volume optimization.

.Steps

. Access the storage system either by running the `telnet` command from the host or from the storage system console.
. Enter the following command:
+
`*snap reserve _vol_name 0_*`
+
`_vol_name_` is the name of the volume on which you want to set the `snap reserve` option.
