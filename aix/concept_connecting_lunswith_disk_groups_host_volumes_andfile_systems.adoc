To use the `snapdrive storage connect` command to connect LUNs that have disk groups, host volumes and file systems, you need to follow the syntax.

Enter the following command:

`*snapdrive storage connect -fs _file_spec_ -hostvol _file_spec_ -lun _long_lun_name_ [_lun_name_...] [-igroup _ig_name_ [_ig_name_...]] [-nopersist] [-mntopts _options_] [-fstype _type_] [-vmtype _type_]*`

== Example: Connecting a file system created on a LUN

# snapdrive storage connect -fs /mnt/fs -lun f270-221-189:/vol/vol0/lun111 -nolvm
