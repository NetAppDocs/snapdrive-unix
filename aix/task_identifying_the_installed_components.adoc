You can identify the installed components on the host platform by using the SnapDrive for UNIX configuration checker tool.

.Steps

. Identify the installed components:
+
`*sdconfcheck detect*`
+
The `sdconfcheck.out` log file is used for identifying the installed components that are in the `/var/log` file. The log files are renamed incrementally as `sdconfcheck.out.1`, `sdconfcheck.out.2`, and so on.
+
The SnapDrive for UNIX configuration checker tool does not detect the Ext3 file system in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 environment. You should run the `modprobe -v ext3` command to load the Ext3 file system.

. You might have to install or configure the component listed after you run the `sdconfcheck detect` command.
