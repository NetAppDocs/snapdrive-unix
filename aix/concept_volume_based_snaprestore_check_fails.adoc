Volume-based SnapRestore (Vbsr) check fails, (when NFS tries to export the list that do not have foreign hosts) in the client machine (SLES 11) that has two different IPs for a host name in the `/etc/hosts` file.

To resolve the problem, you must ensure to have only one IP for a host name in the `/etc/hosts` file.
