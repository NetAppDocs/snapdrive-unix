You can connect to a Snapshot copy that contains LUNs by using the snapdrive snap connect command.

. Enter the following command syntax to connect to a Snapshot copy that contains LUNs: snapdrive snap connect -luns_lun_named_lun_name [[-lun] s_lun_named_lun_name... -snapname long_snap_name [-igroup ig_name [ig_name...]] [-split]
+
NOTE: The s_lun_name and d_lun_name should be in the format lun_name or qtree_name/lun_name.

SnapDrive for UNIX clones the LUNs you specify and connects them to a new location.

The following example connects the LUN mylun1, in hornet/vol/vol1/tuesdaysnapshot to mylun1copy:

----
# ./snapdrive snap connect -lun mylun1 mylun1copy -snapname
hornet:/vol/vol1:tuesdaysnapshot
connecting hornet:/vol/vol1/mylun1:
LUN copy mylun1copy ... created
(original: hornet:/vol/vol1/mylun1) mapping new lun(s) ... done
discovering new lun(s) ... done
----

The following example connects two LUNs, mylun1 and mylun2, to mylun1copy and mylun2copy, respectively:

----
# ./snapdrive snap connect -lun mylun1 mylun1copy -lun mylun2
mylun2copy -snapname hornet:/vol/vol1:tuesdaysnapshot
connecting hornet:/vol/vol1/mylun1:
LUN copy mylun1copy ... created
(original: hornet:/vol/vol1/mylun1)
mapping new lun(s) ... done
connecting hornet:/vol/vol1/mylun2:
LUN copy mylun2copy ... created
(original: hornet:/vol/vol1/mylun2)
mapping new lun(s) ... done
discovering new lun(s) ... done
