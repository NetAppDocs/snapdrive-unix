Thestorage disconnect operation removes the LUNs, or the LUNs and storage entities that were mapped to the host using the snapdrive storage create or snapdrive storage connect command.

Use thesnapdrive storage disconnect command to disconnect:

* LUNs
* A file system created directly on a LUN
* Disk groups, host volumes, and file systems created on LUNs

When SnapDrive for UNIX removes the LUN mappings, it exports the disk groups or file systems that the LUNs contain. This action, which marks the disk and file system as exported, is the only change that disconnecting the mappings has on the contents of the LUNs.
