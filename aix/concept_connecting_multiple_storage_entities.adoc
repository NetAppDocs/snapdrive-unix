You can connect a Snapshot copy containing multiple storage entities.

To connect a Snapshot copy that contains storage entities that reside on multiple destination storage systems you must meet the following requirements:

* The storage entities you specify at the command prompt must reside on a single storage system, or on a HA pair.
* The name of the volume of the source storage system must match the name of the volume of the destination storage system.
* You must set the `_snapmirror-dest-multiple-filervolumes-enabled_` variable in the snapdrive.conf file to "`on`".

You can use one command to connect storage entities that reside on a single storage system or on a HA pair.
