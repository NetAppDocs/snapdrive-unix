The SnapDrive configuration checker tool helps you to identify and verify the configurations supported by SnapDrive for UNIX.

The configuration checker tool addresses the problem of multiple support configurations by verifying the user configuration in both NAS and SAN environments.

The SnapDrive configuration checker tool supports the following configuration checks in SnapDrive for UNIX:

* Checks the configuration specified in the snapdrive.conf file, which is available in the default location.
* Checks the configuration specified using the CLI.
