You can optimize your volume usage in a FC and Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) environment by having host-specific Logical Units Numbers (LUNs) on the same volume.

In addition to this, you can also optimize your volumes by performing a few other tasks:

* When multiple hosts share the same storage system, each host should have its own dedicated storage system volume to hold all the LUNs connected to that host.
* When multiple LUNs exist on a storage system volume, it is best for the dedicated volume, on which the LUNs reside to contain only the LUNs for a single host. It must not contain any other files or directories.
