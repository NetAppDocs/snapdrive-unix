[.lead]
When working with SnapDrive, you must be aware of the limitations related to LUNs.

* A LUN managed by SnapDrive cannot serve either as a boot disk or a system disk.
* SnapDrive does not support the colon (:) in the long forms of the names for LUNs and Snapshot copies.
+
The colon is allowed between the components of a long Snapshot copy name or between the storage system name and storage system volume name of a LUN. For example, toaster:/vol/vol1:snap1 is a typical long Snapshot name, while toaster:/vol/vol1/lunA is a typical long LUN name.
