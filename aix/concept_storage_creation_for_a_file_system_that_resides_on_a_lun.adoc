If you use SnapDrive for UNIX to create a file system that resides directly on a LUN, SnapDrive for UNIX creates and maps the LUN, and then creates and mounts the file system without involving the host LVM.

NOTE: SnapDrive for UNIX operations are not supported when the host's root file system has read-only permissions.
