There are few conditions that affect the `snapdrive snap restore` command's ability to restore a Snapshot copy.

* The `snapdrive snap restore` command must be able to perform the following tasks:
 ** Query all disk groups for a list of LUNs.
 ** Query all LUNs via SCSI command.
The host volumes and file systems do not need to be available and mounted for the `snapdrive snap restore` command to succeed.
* The access permissions must allow the host to create and restore a Snapshot copy of information on that storage system.
* The NFS mounted directory must be exported correctly to the host, so that it can be mounted.

NOTE: You should always take another Snapshot copy after you add a LUN to or remove a LUN from a disk group.

* If you add a host volume or file systems to a disk group after taking a Snapshot copy and then try to restore the Snapshot copy, you receive an error message. You must include the `force` option (`-f`) on the command-line for the restore operation to succeed in this situation.
+
NOTE: Host volumes and file systems that you add after taking a Snapshot copy are no longer accessible when you create and restore the Snapshot copy.

* If you rename a host volume or a file system or change the mountpoint after taking a Snapshot copy and then try to restore it, the restore operation fails. You must include the `force` option (`-f`) on the command-line for the restore operation to succeed in this situation.
+
NOTE: Use the `-f` option with great care to make sure you do not accidentally overwrite something that you did not intend to overwrite.

* If you rename a LUN after taking a Snapshot copy and then try to restore that Snapshot copy, the restore operation fails. After you rename a LUN, you should take a new Snapshot copy.
+
NOTE: After you start a Snapshot restore operation, do not halt it. Halting this operation might leave the system in an inconsistent state. You might then need to perform a manual recovery.
