This is an example of a script that uses exit status values.

The following script uses SnapDrive for UNIX exit status values:

----

	#!/bin/sh
	# This script demonstrates a SnapDrive
	# script that uses exit codes.

	RET=0;
	#The above statement initializes RET and sets it to 0

	snapdrive snap create -dg vg22 -snapname vg22_snap1;
	# The above statement executes the snapdrive command

	RET=$?;
	#The above statement captures the return code.
	#If the operation worked, print
	#success message. If the operation failed, print
	#failure message and exit.

	if [ $RET -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "snapshot created successfully"
	else
	echo "snapshot creation failed, snapdrive exit code was $RET"
	exit 1
	fi
	exit 0;
----

If RET=0, the command executed successfully and the script outputs the following:

----


	# ./tst_script
	snap create: snapshot vg22_snap1 contains:
	disk group vg22 containing host volumes
	lvol1
	snap create: created snapshot betty:/vol/vol2:vg22_snap1
	snapshot created successfully
----

If RET= a value other than zero, the command did not execute successfully. The following example shows typical output:

----

	# ./tst_script
	0001-185 Command error: snapshot betty:/vol/vol2:vg22_snap1 already
	exists on betty:/vol/vol2.
	Please use -f (force) flag to overwrite existing snapshot
	snapshot creation failed, snapdrive exit code was 4
----
