You can use SnapDrive for UNIX commands to provision storage by creating a LUN on the storage system.

.Steps

. At the command-line interface, enter the following command:
+
`*snapdrive storage create -lun _long_lun_name_ -lunsize _[lun_name ...]_ -lunsize__size__ [{-reserve | -noreserve}] -igroup ig_name [ig_name ...]]_ig_name [ig_name ...]]_*`
+
SnapDrive for UNIX creates the LUNs you specify.

== Example: creating three 10 GB LUNs on a storage system

`snapdrive storage create -lun acctfiler:/vol/vol1/lunA lunB lunC - lunsize 10g`
