Use the `snapdrive snap list` command to display the Snapshot copy name.

Another way to get a Snapshot copy name is to log in to the storage system and use the `snapdrive snap list` command there. This command displays the names of the Snapshot copies.

NOTE: The `snapdrive snap show` command is equivalent to the storage system `snapdrive snap list` command.
