SnapDrive for UNIX supports volume migration, which enables you to nondisruptively move a volume from one aggregate to another within the same controller for capacity utilization, improved performance, and to satisfy service-level agreements. In a SAN environment, FlexVol volumes and the LUNs in the volumes are moved nondisruptively from one aggregate to another.

You must set the `_volmove-cutover-retry_` and the `_volmove-cutover-retry-sleep_` variables in the `snapdrive.conf` file to execute SnapDrive operations.
