The snapdrive storage delete command has some restrictions in SnapDrive for UNIX.

* When you delete a file system, SnapDrive for UNIX always removes the file system's mount point.
* If you use the -lun option to specify the name of a LUN that is a member of either a host disk group or a file system, the snapdrive storage delete command fails.
* If you use -lun option to specify the name of the LUN that is not discovered by multipathing software on the host, the snapdrive storage delete command fails.
