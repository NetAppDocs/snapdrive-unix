If a volume is deleted on the Vserver without unmounting the volume on the host system, and when you execute snapdrive storage show -vcommand, the actual path is incorrect.

You might also experience the same when the volume is not junctioned on the Vserver. The following example show the incorrect actual path:

----
# snapdrive storage show -fs /mnt /file1 -v
NFS device: vs1:/vol_test1 mount point: /mnt
(non-persistent)
Protocol: NFS Actual Path:
vs1:/vol/roovol1/vol_test1
