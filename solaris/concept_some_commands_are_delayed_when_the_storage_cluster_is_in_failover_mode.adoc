SnapDrive for UNIX commands that create, connect, delete, or disconnect a LUN take several minutes to complete on a Solaris host when one of the clustered storage system is down.

Such commands are snapdrive storage create, snapdrive storage connect, snapdrive storage delete, snapdrive storage disconnect, snapdrive snap connect, snapdrive snap disconnect, and, sometimes, snapdrive snap restore.

This problem affects snapdrive snap restore only when SnapDrive for UNIX needs to restore LUNs that are deleted or disconnected.
