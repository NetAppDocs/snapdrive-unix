Follow these guidelines when using the `snapdrive storage disconnect` command:

* When you disconnect a file system, SnapDrive for UNIX always removes the mountpoint.
* If you use the `-lun` option to specify the name of a LUN that is a member of either a host disk group, or a file system, the `snapdrive storage disconnect` command fails.
* If you use `-lun` option to specify the name of the LUN that is not discovered by multipathing software on the host, the `snapdrive storage disconnect` command fails.
