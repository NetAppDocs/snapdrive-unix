SnapDrive for UNIX does not show the supported file system types for storage create operation.

The snapdrive storage create operation fails to create a UFS file system over raw LUNs (LUNs without any volume manager components), using the -fstype option and the iSCSI transport, if the following are true:

* UFS file system is present
* VxVM components (VxVM, VxFS and DMP) are not installed
* HBA driver for Emulex is loaded

The following error message is displayed, if the operation fails.
