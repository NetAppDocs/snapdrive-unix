You can delete a user login of a virtual interface, by executing the snapdrive config delete command.

Ensure that you have configured the Virtual Storage Console in the vCenter.

. Enter the following command: snapdrive config delete appliance_name
+
appliance_name is the name or the IP address of the virtual interface system.

SnapDrive for UNIX removes the user name or password login information for the virtual interface you specify.

NOTE: To enable SnapDrive for UNIX to access the virtual interface, you must specify a new user login.
