On Solaris hosts, creating a UFS file system directly on a LUN fails.

When you have both UFS and Veritas stack installed on the same Solaris host, and after setting the default-transport configuration variable as iscsi, SnapDrive for UNIX does not pick UFS as the default file system for creating a file system directly on a LUN. The operation fails with the following error message:

----
0002-138 Admin error: Transport Type: iscsi Volume Manager: VxVM is
not supported combination.
----

== Workaround

Use the ufs value for the -fstype command to create a UFS file system directly on a LUN.
