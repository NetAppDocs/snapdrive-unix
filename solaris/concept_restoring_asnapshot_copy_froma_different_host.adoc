Use the snapdrive snap restore command to restore a Snapshot copy from a different host.

Usually, you can restore a Snapshot copy from the host where you took the Snapshot copy. Occasionally, you might need to restore a Snapshot copy using a different or non-originating host. To restore a Snapshot copy using a non-originating host, use the same snapdrive snap restore command that you would normally use. If the Snapshot copy you restore contains NFS entities, the non-originating host must have permission to access the NFS directory.
