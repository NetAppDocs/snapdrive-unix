To use the snapdrive storage connect command to connect LUNs that have disk groups, host volumes and file systems, you need to follow the syntax.

Enter the following command: snapdrive storage connect-fsfile_spec -hostvolfile_spec -lunlong_lun_name [lun_name...] [-igroupig_name [ig_name...]] [-nopersist] [-mntoptsoptions] [-fstypetype] [-vmtypetype]

== Example: Connecting a file system created on a LUN

----
# snapdrive storage connect -fs /mnt/fs -lun f270-221-189:/vol/vol0/lun111 -nolvm
mapping lun(s) ... done
discovering lun(s) ... done
LUN f270-221-189:/vol/vol0/lun111 connected
- device filename(s): /dev/vx/dmp/fas2700_939
