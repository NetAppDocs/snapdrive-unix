You can create a host entity such as a file system, logical volume, or disk group and specify the LUN that is created as part of it.

.Steps

. At the command line, enter the following command:
+
`*snapdrive storage create _-host_lvm_fspec_ -lun _long_lun_name_ [_lun_name..._] -lunsize _size_ [-igroup _ig_name_ [_ig_name..._]] [{ -reserve | -noreserve }]*`
+
This example on a Solaris host creates the file system acctfs on three LUNs and explicitly names the volume group and host volume underneath it. Each LUN is 10 GB:
+
`# snapdrive storage create -fs /mnt/acctfs -hostvol acctfsdg/acctfshv -lun acctfiler:/vol/vol1/lunA lunB lunC -lunsize 10g`
+
