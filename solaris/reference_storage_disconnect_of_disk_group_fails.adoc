On storage systems using Solaris version 10, update 10 or later, the SnapDrive for UNIX command to delete and disconnect the disk groups fails without the `-full` option. The delete and disconnect command fails because the host volumes are not completely disconnected or deleted.

== Workaround

Run the `-full` command to disconnect all file systems and associated host volumes.
