When the host system is restarted, the storage area network file specification created with Solaris Volume Manager (SVM) using iSCSI, does not mount automatically and the host does not start.

If the host starts, then you can mount the file specification by using the steps mentioned.

== Workaround

. Enter the metaset
+
`*-s dgname -t*`
+
command to change the disk set ownership manually.
+
NOTE: Ensure that metadb is defined.

. Enter the
+
`*mount -a*`
+
command to mount the file specification.
