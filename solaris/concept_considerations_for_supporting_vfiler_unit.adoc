SnapDrive for UNIX supports SnapDrive operations on a vFiler unit created on a FlexVol volume. However, SnapDrive for UNIX does not support vFiler units if you are using Fibre Channel (FC).

You must be aware of some considerations related to SnapDrive for UNIX supporting vFiler units:

* SnapDrive operations are not supported on a vFiler unit that was created on a qtree.
+
These operations are allowed if the vFiler unit owns the entire storage volume.

* When configuring SnapDrive to support vFiler units, you must ensure that the management and data paths are not configured for an interface on vFiler0.
