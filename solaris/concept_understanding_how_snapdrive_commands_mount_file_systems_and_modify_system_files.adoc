When a command performs an operation that mounts a file system, SnapDrive for UNIX adds the file systemâ€™s name to the standard system file for your host platform.

Certain SnapDrive for UNIX commands can cause file systems to be mounted or unmounted. When a command performs an operation that mounts a file system, SnapDrive for UNIX adds the file system's name to the standard system file for your host platform. If an operation unmounts a file system, SnapDrive for UNIX removes the name from the system file. This should not pose a problem; however, it is useful to know when system files are modified.

The name of the system file varies depending on your host platform. The following table lists the host platforms and their system files.
