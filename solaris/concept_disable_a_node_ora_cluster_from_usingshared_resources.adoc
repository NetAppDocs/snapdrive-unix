You have to modify the `/etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf` file to disable a node from using a shared resource. For more information about the main.cf file, see the Veritas Cluster Server _Installation Guide for Solaris_.

To disable a node from using a shared resource, use the following syntax:

`*snapdrive storage disconnect -fs _file_spec_ -lun _long_lun_name_ [_lun_name..._] [-devicetype shared]*`
