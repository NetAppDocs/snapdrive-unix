You can use SnapDrive for UNIX to carry out thin provisioning for NFS entities on your storage system. Thin provisioning is referred as space-reservation.

. To enable space reservation for snap connect operations, you can enable space reservation for volumes by using the `_-reserve_` parameter with the commands involving NFS entities. For NFS entities, SnapDrive for UNIX uses the space reservation available in the Snapshot copy if the `_-reserve_` or `_-noreserve_` parameters are not specified in a command.
