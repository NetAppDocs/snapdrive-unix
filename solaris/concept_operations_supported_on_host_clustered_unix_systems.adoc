SnapDrive for UNIX on host clustered UNIX systems enables you to create storage andperform Snapshot operations on a host cluster-wide shared storage.

Snapshot operations are performed on a storage system that includes disk groups, file systems, and LUNs. You can perform Snapshot operations such as create, rename, restore, connect, disconnect, display, and delete.

NOTE: The operations for host clustered systems are available only for Veritas SFRAC on a Solaris host.
