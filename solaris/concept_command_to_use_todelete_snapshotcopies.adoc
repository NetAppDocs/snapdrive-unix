Use the snapdrive snap delete command to delete a Snapshot copy.

The snapdrive snap delete command removes the Snapshot copies you specify from a storage system. This command does not perform any operations on the host. It only removes the Snapshot copy from a storage system, if you have permission to do so. (If you want to keep the LUNs and mappings.)
