You can split the existing FlexClone volume using the SnapDrive for UNIX commands.

To split the FlexClone volume you need to additionally specify the -split CLI option with the snap connect command. To disconnect, you should provide the -split option with the disconnect command to disconnect the split FlexClone volume. The blocking and non-blocking modes of initiating a -split operation are valid here.
