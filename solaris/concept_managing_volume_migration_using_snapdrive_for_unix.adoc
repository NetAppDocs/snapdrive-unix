You can execute SnapDrive operations during volume migration.

The volume migration consists of the following three phases:

* Setup
* Move
* Cutover

SnapDrive for UNIX operations function smoothly in setup and move phases.

When you execute any SnapDrive commands during the cutover phase, SnapDrive for UNIX can retry the operation as defined in the variables `_volmove-cutover-retry_` and `_volmove-cutover-retry-sleep_` in the `snapdrive.conf` file.

NOTE: If SnapDrive for UNIX operations fail during the volume migration, you must perform the SnapDrive for UNIX operations after the volume migration operations are completed.
