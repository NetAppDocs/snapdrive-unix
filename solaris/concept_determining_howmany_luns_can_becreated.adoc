SnapDrive for UNIX lets you determine how many LUNs can be created on the host without exceeding the limit.

You can use `snapdrive config check luns` command to determine this value.

On a Solaris host, this command scans `/kernel/drv/sd.conf` to determine how many unused entries would be suitable for LUNs.
