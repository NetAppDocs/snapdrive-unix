The following are the guidelines to disconnect a Snapshot copy for LUNs, storage entities, or NFS directories.

* When you disconnect a file system, SnapDrive for UNIX always removes the mountpoint.
* To undo the effects of the Snapshot connect operation, use the Snapshot disconnect command.
* If you set the `_enable-split-clone_` configuration variable value to `on` or `sync` during the Snapshot connect operation and `off` during the Snapshot disconnect operation, SnapDrive for UNIX does not delete the original volume or LUN that is present in the Snapshot copy.
