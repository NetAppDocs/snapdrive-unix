You can restore a Snapshot copy that contains multiple storage entities.

To restore a Snapshot copy that contains storage entities that reside on multiple destination storage systems, you must meet the following requirements:

* The storage entities you specify at the command prompt must reside on a single storage system, or on a HA pair.
* The name of the volume of the source storage system must match the name of the volume of the destination storage system.
* You must set the snapmirror-dest-multiple-filervolumes-enabled argument in the snapdrive.conf file to on.

You can use one command to restore storage entities that reside on a single storage system or on a HA pair.
