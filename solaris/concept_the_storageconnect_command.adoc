The snapdrive storage connect command connects storage entities to the host. Using this command you can connect LUNs and storage entities to the host

Use the snapdrive storage connect command to connect to:

* LUNs
* A file system created directly on a LUN
* Disk groups, host volumes, and file systems created on LUNs

When you enter the snapdrive storage connect command to connect LUNs to the host, SnapDrive for UNIX performs the necessary discovery and mapping. It does not modify LUN contents.
